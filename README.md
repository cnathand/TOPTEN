Welcome to TOPTEN, a website created by Nathan and Hassan. 

**Name**: Hassan Sajid and Nathan Dechyothin
**Date**: October 25, 2024
**Project Name**: Favorite Top Ten Website
**Description**: We, Nathan and I, created a website that shows our personal rankings on subjects we chose. Nathan chose sodas and I, Hassan, chose to rank cars. The website has a landing page and a navbar which links the landing page, Nathan's page, and Hassan's page so the user has a easy experience navigating through the website.
